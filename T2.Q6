What is the output of the following code examples

Ans:

x = 123
for i in x:
    print(i)

This will result in a TypeError as Interger is not iterable.

i = 0
while i < 5:
    print(i)
    i += 1
    if i == 3:
        break
    else:
        print(“error”)

Output:
0 
error
1

count = 0
while True:
    print(count)
    count += 1
    if count >= 5:
        break
