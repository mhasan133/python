4. Create a login page backend to ask users to enter the username and password. Make sure to
ask for a Re-Type Password and if the password is incorrect give chance to enter it again but it
should not be more than 3 times.

Ans:

CHANCES = 3
USERNAME = "admin"
PASSWORD = "admin"

count = 0
while count != CHANCES:
    user_name = input("Enter Username: ")
    password = input("Enter password: ")

    if user_name != USERNAME and password != PASSWORD:
        print("Username/password entered was wrong, please try again!")
        count  += 1
        if count == CHANCES:
            print("You lost all chances to login")
        continue
    else:
        print("Login Success")
        break
        
        
        
        C:\Users\hasan\PycharmProjects\pythonProject\venv\Scripts\python.exe C:/Users/hasan/PycharmProjects/pythonProject/main.py
Enter Username: admin
Enter password: admin
Login Success

Process finished with exit code 0
