Q 8: 

If one data type value is assigned to ‘a’ variable and then a different data type value is assigned to ‘a’
again. Will it change the value? If Yes then Why?

Ans 8:

a = 10
a = "Hi"
print(a)

yes, the value will be changed since python always execute line by line and also execute the last line.
