(i) 
def foo():
    try:
        return 1
    finally:
        return 2
k = foo()
print(k)

(ii)

def a():
    try:
        f(x, 4)
    finally:
        print('after f')
        print('after f?')

a()

Ans:
Here the function will throw error as `f` function is not found and is not handled by using `except`
