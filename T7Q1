1. Write a program that calculates and prints the value according to the given formula:
Q= Square root of [(2*C*D)/H]
Following are the fixed values of C and H:
C is 50.
H is 30.
D is a variable whose values should be input to your program in a comma-separated sequence.


Ans:

import math
d = input("enter multiple numbers ( comma seperated): ")
d = list(eval(d))

C = 50
H = 30

for i in d:
    q = math.sqrt((2 * C * i)/ H)
    print(q)
