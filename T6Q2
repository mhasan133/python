Write a program to construct a dictionary from the two lists containing the names of students and
their corresponding subjects. The dictionary should map the students with their respective subjects.
Letâ€™s see how to do this using for loops and dictionary comprehension.


Ans:

students = ['Smit', 'Jaya', 'Rayyan']
subjects = ['CSE', 'Networking', 'Operating System']

ss_dict = dict(zip(students, subjects))

print(ss_dict)

{'Smit': 'CSE', 'Jaya': 'Networking', 'Rayyan': 'Operating System'}
